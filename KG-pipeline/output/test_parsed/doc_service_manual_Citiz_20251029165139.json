In  order to take full advantage of all the \nfunctions, it is absolutely necessary to follow the instructions in this manual.\nFor fast access to info rmation directly from the PC or MAC monitor, this service manual \nis available as PDF file and can be downloaded from the Nespresso  technical website \nunder https://business.nespresso.com .\nThe required utility so ftware to read PDF files (Adobe Reader®) for PCs and MAC \ncomputers can be downloaded (under http://www.adobe.com ) for free - please click t he \nlogo:\nCONTENT UPDATES\nVersion 1.0\n• First released service manual version in English.Please keep this \nmanual together with \nthe corresponding \nservice documentation. \nThis way you are assured \nto have the necessary information.\nThe version number of this service manua l \nis printed on the lower \nright corner of the front \npage.\n\nCitiz service manual 6GENERAL SAFETY NOTES\n1 GENERAL SAFETY NOTES\nAs an additional safety measur e, the use of a residual cu rrent device (RCD), also called \nthe ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), in the repair centre is highly recommended.Risk of fatal electrical shock and fire!\nMains voltage inside the coffee machine. \n• Unplug appliance before cleaning.\n• Never clean wet or immerse plug, cord or appliance in any fluid.• Disconnect the mains plug before disassembly - the appliance must \nbe free of voltage.\nThis device does \nnot protect against \nelectrical shock due \nto contact with both cir-\ncuit conductors.\nExample illustrations \nof typical devices.\nUse a GFCI with a trip \nlevel of 4 - 6 mA (USA) resp. a RCD with a trip \nlevel of 15 - 30 mA (Eu rope). A trip level above 30 mA provides only very limited \nprotection against harm \nfrom an electric shock.\n1) RCD protected socket-outlet \n2) Plug-in RCD unit3) GFCI socket4) Plug-in GFCI\nDanger of burns!\nHot parts and water under pressure inside the coffee machine \n(particularly in the thermoblock).\n• Let coffee machine cool down before cleaning or disassembly.1\n2RESET\nTEST\nRESET\nTEST3\n4\n\nCitiz service manual 7MODEL OVERVIEW\n2 MODEL OVERVIEW\n2.1 Model range\nWith core unit D-range:                          With core unit C-range:\nEach model \n- has a special platform\n- is available in 2 different designs, depending on the core unit version (C- or D-range).1) Citiz\n2) Citiz & milk1\n2EF 452 D111\nEF 468 D121EF 451 C111\nEF 467 C121\nA core unit is the \nactual coffee \nmachine, mounted on \na platform.\n\nCitiz service manual 8MODEL OVERVIEW\n2.2 Core unit versions\nD-range C-rangeThis comparison \nhelps to identify the core unit version.\n1) Coffee outlet\n2) Closing handle3) Coffee buttons4) Cup holder112233\n4 4\nThere are additional \ndifferences between \nthe 2 versions (cov-\ners, wiring etc.) not men-\ntioned in the table.Different components D-range C-range\nCoffee outlet (1) contured coffee outlet \"flat\" coffee outlet\nClosing handle (2) chromium-plated closing handle black closing handle\nCoffee buttons (3)arranged on both sides of the \nclosing handlearranged behind the closing handle\nCup holder (4) cup holder with slotted recesses cup holder with circular recesses\n\nCitiz service manual 9MAIN COMPONENTS\n3 MAIN COMPONENTS\n3.1 Overview -

Then a \ntest voltage is applied between phase/neutral  and selected parts of the coffee machine.\nTest equipment\nSpecial test equipment is nee ded that complies with the regulations to perform insulation \nand withstanding voltage tests.  Detailed requirements and tolerances must be verified \nwith your local author ities or measurement supplier in any case.\nIdeally the test equipment has a national power socket for testing, so that the coffee machine can plugged in directly. Otherwise a special shunt is necessary to connect the phase and neutral pin of the coffee machine’s power plug.\nTest report\nFor legal reasons a repair or test report sh ould be prepared and filed with following infor-\nmation\n- customer (name, address)- type and serial number of coffee machine\n- date of repair/test(s)\n- performed test(s)/measuring value(s), test points- used test equipment\n-s i g n a t u r ePerform the protec-\ntive earth (PE) conti-nuity test at first, if it is \nmandatory.\nAsk Nespresso  for \nrecommendations about test equipment.\n\nCitiz service manual 114FUNCTION TESTS\n9.8.3 Test sequence\nDanger of electrical shock/short circuit! \nDo not plug in the coffee machine during insulation test.\nDanger of electrical shock! \nDo not touch tip of test probes.Do not touch metallic parts of coffee machine during test.Read and observe safety instructions in user manual of test equipment.\nA Swiss power plug is \nshown here as an \nexample.\nUse a short circuit \nplug or special alliga-\ntor clips etc. as sub-\nstitute for this test adapter.1) Connect the phase and neutral pin of \nthe power plug together with a test \nadapter (procured by the repair centre).\n2) Connect the black measuring cable to \nthe test adapter (see image).\nSymbolic illustration \nof test equipment.\n3) Switch on test equipment and select \nan insulation test voltage of 500 V DC.MEASURE\nLOCK/STOPCOMP\nLIGHT0Ω ADJ\nSome test equipment displays test passed \nor failed instead of \nthe insulation resistance.\n4) Touch closing handle with red test \nprobe.\n5) Press \"measure\" button.\n6) Read off displaye d insulation resis-\ntance or test result.\nThe insulation resistance must be \nhigher than 300 kOhm (300,000 Ohm).5.\n6.\nTest passed\n\nCitiz service manual 115FUNCTION TESTS\nThe coffee machine \nCitiz & Co has 2 test \nholes to check both \nthermoblocks.\n7)Touch thermoblock with red test \nprobe.\n8) Press \"measure\" button.9) Read off displayed insulation resis-\ntance or te st result. \nThe insulation resistance must be \nhigher than 300 kOhm (300’000 Ohm).\n10) Switch off test equipment.11) Short red with black test probe to \nmake sure that test voltage is dis-charged.\n12) Fill in results in a test report.\nAdditional tests for coffee machine \nCitiz & milk:\n1) Touch upper metallic part of milk \nfrother with red test probe.\n2)  Press \"measure\" button.\n3) Read off displayed insulation resis-\ntance or test result.4.\nMEASURE\nLOCK/STOPCOMP\nLIGHT0Ω ADJ0.215 Ohm\nTest passed3.\n1.\n3.\n2.\nTest passed\n\nCitiz service manual 116FUNCTION TESTS\n9.8.4 What to do if th e insulation test fails\n• Assume that the coffee machine is defect after a failed insulation test.\n• Check wiring and locate fault.
