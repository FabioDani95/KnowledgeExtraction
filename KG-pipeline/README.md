# Knowledge Graph Extraction Pipeline

A proof-of-concept implementation for automated knowledge graph generation from unstructured documents. This pipeline transforms PDF documents into structured knowledge graphs by extracting entities, relationships, and their contextual information using Large Language Models.

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for converting document collections into machine-readable knowledge representations. The pipeline processes PDF files, extracts semantic information, and structures it into a graph format suitable for downstream applications such as semantic search, question answering, and knowledge discovery.

## Architecture

The pipeline follows a modular architecture consisting of several core components:

### Document Processing Layer
- **PDF Ingestion**: Handles document loading and text extraction from PDF files
- **Text Chunking**: Implements intelligent document segmentation to maintain semantic coherence while respecting LLM context windows
- **Preprocessing**: Normalizes and cleans extracted text for optimal processing

### Knowledge Extraction Layer
- **Entity Recognition**: Identifies and extracts domain-specific entities from text
- **Relationship Extraction**: Discovers semantic relationships between identified entities
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains source references and contextual information for traceability

### Graph Construction Layer
- **Schema Definition**: Enforces consistent ontological structure across extracted knowledge
- **Graph Builder**: Constructs the knowledge graph data structure with nodes (entities) and edges (relationships)
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Augments graph elements with additional contextual information

### Storage & Export Layer
- **Serialization**: Converts graph structures to standard formats (JSON, RDF, GraphML)
- **Persistence**: Manages storage of extracted knowledge graphs
- **Query Interface**: Provides mechanisms for graph traversal and information retrieval

## Technical Stack

- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language
- **PyPDF2**: PDF document parsing and text extraction
- **OpenAI API**: LLM-powered entity and relationship extraction
- **PyYAML**: Configuration management
- **tiktoken**: Token counting and context window management

## Key Features

### Automated Knowledge Extraction
The pipeline leverages advanced language models to automatically identify entities and relationships without requiring manual annotation or domain-specific training data.

### Scalable Processing
Modular design allows for parallel processing of multiple documents and incremental graph construction, enabling handling of large document collections.

### Flexible Schema
Supports customizable entity types and relationship definitions, allowing adaptation to various domains and use cases.

### Provenance Tracking
Maintains links between extracted knowledge and source documents, enabling verification and audit trails.

## Use Cases

This proof-of-concept addresses several practical applications:

- **Document Understanding**: Transform unstructured reports, papers, and documentation into queryable knowledge bases
- **Information Integration**: Merge knowledge from multiple sources into unified graph representations
- **Semantic Search**: Enable conceptual search beyond keyword matching by leveraging entity and relationship information
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Identify non-obvious connections and patterns across document collections
- **Decision Support**: Provide structured information for analytical and decision-making processes

## Pipeline Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Load configuration parameters and API credentials
2. **Document Loading**: Read PDF files from specified input directory
3. **Text Extraction**: Parse documents and extract textual content
4. **Chunking**: Segment long documents into processable units
5. **Entity Extraction**: Identify relevant entities within each chunk
6. **Relationship Extraction**: Discover connections between entities
7. **Graph Construction**: Build the knowledge graph structure
8. **Serialization**: Export the graph to desired format
9. **Validation**: Verify graph integrity and completeness

## Configuration

The pipeline uses configuration files to manage:

- API endpoints and credentials
- Processing parameters (chunk size, overlap, etc.)
- Entity and relationship schemas
- Output format specifications
- Logging and monitoring settings

## Installation

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the pipeline on a directory of PDFs
python main.py --input ./documents --output ./graphs

# Process a single document
python main.py --input document.pdf --output output.json
```

## Output Format

The pipeline generates knowledge graphs in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "id": "entity_id",
      "type": "entity_type",
      "name": "entity_name",
      "attributes": {...},
      "source": "document_reference"
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source": "entity_id_1",
      "target": "entity_id_2",
      "type": "relationship_type",
      "properties": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **API Rate Limits**: Implements throttling to respect OpenAI API constraints
- **Cost Optimization**: Uses efficient chunking strategies to minimize token usage
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic for API failures and malformed responses
- **Memory Management**: Processes documents in batches to handle large collections

## Limitations & Future Work

As a proof-of-concept, this implementation has several areas for enhancement:

- **Coreference Resolution**: Currently does not merge entity mentions across chunks
- **Relationship Validation**: Limited verification of extracted relationship semantics
- **Graph Deduplication**: Basic entity matching may create duplicate nodes
- **Visualization**: No built-in graph visualization capabilities
- **Incremental Updates**: Does not support updating existing graphs with new documents
